Warnings: I had trouble with the plot portion I was confused on what n values I should use. I was
also confused on how I should label the points. My graph is not stable i choose the function to go from 100 to 200 because it I went any higher it would run to slow.  
I was also confused with the conditional probability methods in alien_bayes.py I used the
technique that was shown in slide 13.
